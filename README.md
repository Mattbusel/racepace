# Race Pace

A running pace and split calculator built like a finish-line clock: distance and goal time in, pace and every split out.

## Features

- Pace from time or time from pace, miles or kilometres, seven-segment LED clock
- Every split as a lane of track, with the clock time at each marker
- Race predictor (Riegel), "if you ran" ladder
- Negative split, build or custom split strategies; gel fueling plan with sources
- Race-day mode: tap each marker, see seconds ahead or behind
- Printable pace band PDF and a share card

## Price

Free download. Race Pace Pro is a one-time $3.99 in-app purchase. No subscription, no ads.

## Privacy

No network code: Race Pace makes no requests and collects no data. The privacy manifest (`Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) declares no tracking and no collected data types.

## Built without a Mac

This app was written on a Windows PC. No Mac is involved at any point: every build, signature, screenshot and App Store submission runs on GitHub Actions macOS runners, driven by the App Store Connect API.

- **`project.yml`** is an [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) spec. The `.xcodeproj` is generated on the runner and never committed, so the repo can be edited on any OS and there are no `.pbxproj` merge conflicts.
- **`.github/workflows/build.yml`** runs on every push: picks the newest Xcode 26 and iPhone simulator on the runner, builds, then launches the app once per screen with `-shot <screen>` (sample data, fixed 9:41 status bar) and captures the store screenshots with `simctl`, uploaded as a workflow artifact.
- **`.github/workflows/appstore.yml`** (manual) has three modes: `compile`, `dry_run` (build, sign, upload, do not submit) and `release` (also submits for review). The distribution certificate is imported from a secret into a throwaway keychain; [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) (`fastlane/Fastfile`) fetches the App Store profile with the API key, sets the build number one above the latest on TestFlight, archives, and uploads the binary with `fastlane/metadata` and the committed `fastlane/screenshots`.
- **`.github/workflows/review-video.yml`** records the App Review screen recording: the app is launched with `-demoAutoplay` and drives its own real screens.
- **`Store/*.py`** talk to the App Store Connect API directly from Windows (Python, `requests` + `PyJWT`): `asc.py` registers the bundle id and pushes metadata, `listing.py` sets the age rating, review details, price and screenshots, and `signing.py` creates the distribution certificate locally so its private key is never stranded on a disposable runner.

Only one step is manual: Apple's API will not create the app record itself, so that is made once in the App Store Connect web UI.

## Build and run

With a Mac and Xcode 26 (the version CI uses; the app targets iOS 17+):

```bash
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
open RacePace.xcodeproj
```

Run the `RacePace` scheme on any iPhone simulator. No signing is needed for the simulator; from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild build -project RacePace.xcodeproj -scheme RacePace \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

To see it filled with sample data, launch with a screenshot argument, e.g. `xcrun simctl launch booted com.mattbusel.racepace -shot calc`.

Without a Mac: fork the repo and push. The Build workflow compiles it on a GitHub macOS runner and attaches the screenshots as an artifact.

Shipping your own build needs these repository secrets: `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_KEY_CONTENT` (base64 of the `.p8`), `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, `DIST_CERT_P12`, `DIST_CERT_PASSWORD`, plus your own bundle id in `project.yml` and `fastlane/Fastfile`.

## Code map

All app code is in `Sources/` (SwiftUI, Observation, no third-party dependencies).

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `App.swift` | entry point, tab bar, `-shot` handling |
| `Model.swift` | pets, schedules, doses, supplies, vaccines, weights, JSON persistence |
| `TodayView.swift` | the dose board and who is ticking |
| `Reminders.swift` | local notifications with Given and Snooze actions |
| `PetsView.swift` / `PetFace.swift` | pets, and drawn faces for pets without a photo |
| `VetView.swift` / `HealthView.swift` | vaccines, visits, weight and notes |
| `PDFs.swift` / `SitterView.swift` | the vet summary and sitter sheet as US Letter PDFs |
| `Editors.swift` | shared editor frame and forms |
| `Theme.swift` | oatmeal and persimmon look |
| `Demo.swift` / `Autopilot.swift` | the three-pet demo household and the App Review recording |

`Store/` holds the App Store Connect scripts, `fastlane/` the lanes, listing text and screenshots, `Resources/` the asset catalog and privacy manifest.
